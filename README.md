==========

Markdown-based note organization.

Artnotizen uses [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to compile Markdown to HTML. As this cannot be expressed as a Python dependency, it must be installed manually. On Debian-based Linux systems, you can use:
```bash
  sudo apt-get install pandoc
```
